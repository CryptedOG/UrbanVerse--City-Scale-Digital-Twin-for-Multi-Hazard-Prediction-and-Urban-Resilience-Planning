## 📌 Executive Summary & Problem Statement

Coastal cities like **Mangalore** face severe, compounding climate and urban hazards during the Indian monsoon:
* **Severe Tidal & River Estuary Inundation**: Low-lying sectors like Bunder ($4\text{m}$ elevation) experience tidal backflow from the Gurupura River estuary.
* **Critical Highway Bottlenecks**: Major arterial junctions like **Pumpwell (Mahaveer Circle)** on NH-66 suffer paralyzing waterlogging every single monsoon, stranding emergency vehicles and cutting off hospital access.
* **Compound Multi-Hazards**: Beyond flooding, cities experience intense **Urban Heat Islands (UHI)** in commercial centers (Hampankatta), severe **Air Pollution (AQI)** along port freight corridors (Baikampady), and rainfall-induced **cutting slope landslides** on laterite ridges (Kadri / Nanthoor).

### The Current Problem
Current government emergency alerts are broad and blunt (e.g., *"Red Alert for Dakshina Kannada district"*). They do not tell citizens or emergency responders **which micro-zone will submerge, which specific roads are blocked, or where to deploy pumps before roads are impassable.**

### The UrbanVerse Solution
**UrbanVerse** bridges this gap by creating an interactive, city-scale **Urban Digital Twin** combining real OpenStreetMap spatial layers, satellite digital elevation models (DEM), a multi-hazard predictive heuristic engine, and a 4-tier resilience triage system (**P1 Critical to P4 Low**).

---

## ✨ Key Platform Features

### 1. Dual Spatial Exploration: 2D GIS Map & 3D Structural Twin
* **2D GIS Map (Leaflet.js)**: Fast, low-bandwidth spatial triage interface for emergency dispatchers and field personnel. Delivers real-time zone risk color coding, hover tooltips, and infrastructure markers.
* **3D Digital Twin (Three.js)**: High-fidelity isometric 3D city visualization featuring elevated terrain platforms matching actual topography ($4\text{m}$ to $24\text{m}$) and a **dynamic water plane that rises physically in 3D** as rainfall increases.
* **Jury Justification**: 2D is optimized for rapid regional triage; 3D is optimized for structural inundation and elevation analysis.

### 2. Real-World Mangalore Hotspots & OpenStreetMap Ingestion
Includes real surveyed geometries from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and 30-meter satellite DEM elevation rasters for Mangalore’s three most critical transit and hazard corridors:
* **🌊 Pumpwell (Mahaveer Circle, 12m)**: 22 real building footprints (including Indiana Hospital), 78 road segments, 5 waterways, and 30m DEM elevation raster.
* **⛰️ Nanthoor Junction (36m–78m)**: 147 real surveyed buildings and 105 road segments on the elevated Kadri laterite ridge (safe evacuation corridor).
* **🏖️ Surathkal Coastal Suburb (13m)**: 32 buildings and 88 road segments prone to Arabian Sea surge.

### 3. Multi-Hazard Predictive Engine
Simulates 4 interconnected urban hazards using transparent mathematical heuristics:
1. **Urban Flooding**: Elevation vulnerability ($40\%$), river proximity ($35\%$), and drainage deficit ($25\%$) scaled by non-linear rainfall volume.
2. **Urban Heat Island (UHI)**: Surface thermal anomalies based on asphalt/concrete density vs. tree canopy cover.
3. **Air Pollution Exposure**: Localized AQI dispersion along logistics corridors and port transit routes.
4. **Slope Instability / Landslide**: Geomorphological slope failure on elevated cutting slopes (Kadri Ridge).

### 4. 4-Tier Resilience Hierarchy & Civilian Evacuation Triage
Zones are ranked from highest to lowest Composite Risk:
$$\text{Composite Risk} = 0.55 \times \text{Hazard} + (0.25 \times \text{Exposure} + 0.20 \times \text{Vulnerability}) \times \text{Hazard Activation}$$

| Tier | Priority Label | Trigger Criteria | Action Required |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1** | **Critical** | Composite $\ge 75$ or Hazard $\ge 90$ | Immediate evacuation alert; deploy dewatering pumps to low-lying outfalls. |
| **P2** | **High** | $55 \le \text{Composite} < 75$ | Pre-position mobile pumps; issue traffic rerouting advisories. |
| **P3** | **Moderate** | $35 \le \text{Composite} < 55$ | Municipal monitoring; clear culverts and open pedestrian cooling shelters. |
| **P4** | **Low / Safe** | Composite $< 35$ | Routine baseline operations; designated safe civilian refuge zones. |
